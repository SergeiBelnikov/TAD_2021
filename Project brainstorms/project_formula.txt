Formula for text-as-data research

What source of text data will you use?

What are two possible answers to the question?

Yes, it does
No, it does not 

If it does and results are statistically significant there is ground for more detailed questions.

How will the results of the quantitative text analysis demonstrate which of those answers is correct?
